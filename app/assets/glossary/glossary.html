<h3>accuracy</h3><p>Exact conformity to truth, or presenting the known facts, and refraining from speculation, or extrapolation. In the case of journalism, some experts prioritize "accuracy" over objectivity.

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>abbreviation</h3><p>An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. Usually, but not always, it consists of a letter or group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word abbreviation can itself be represented by the abbreviation abbr., abbrv. or abbrev. Other examples of abbreviations as NGO, UN, HRD, etc. (partly adapted from: <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation</a>)</p></p></div>


	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>accuracy</h3><p>A journalists first obligation is to the truth, and this can only be done if stories are reported accurate. This means that reporters are expected to be as accurate as possible given the time allotted to story preparation and the space available, and to seek reliable sources.</p></p></div>

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>advocacy</h3><p>Advocacy is a political process by an individual or group which aims to influence public-policy and resource allocation decisions within political, economic, and social systems and institutions. Advocacy may be motivated from moral, ethical or faith principles or simply a desire to protect an asset of interest.

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>angle</h3><p>An angle is really the main objective of the article. You might have chosen a topic for your story, but you also need to have an angle to make it attractive. The topic for a story might be 'Street violence', but then you still need an angle that is interesting for people, such as: 'How is street violence affecting business in district A' or: 'How did city C get rid of street violence?' or: 'How to protect yourself from street violence'.</p></p></div>


	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>anonimity</h3><p>Anonymity typically refers to the state of an individual's personal identity, or personally identifiable information, being publicly unknown. There are various situations in which a person might choose to withhold their identity. Acts of charity have been performed anonymously when benefactors do not wish to be acknowledged. A person who feels threatened might attempt to mitigate that threat through anonymity. A witness to a crime might seek to avoid retribution, for example, by anonymously calling a crime tipline. Criminals might proceed anonymously to conceal their participation in a crime. (<a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity</a>)</p></p></div>


	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>anonymity (online)</h3><p>Anonymity is often confused with Pseudonymity. On the internet much content is effectively anonymous to the majority of the public, as it is published by individuals using pseudonymous or choosing to be "anonymous." Full anonymity on the Internet, however, is not guaranteed since IP addresses and MAC addresses, in principle, can be tracked, allowing to identify the computer from which a certain post was made, albeit not the actual user. Anonymizing services such as I2P</h3><p>The Anonymous Network or Tor address the issue of IP tracking.

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>audio</h3><p>The aperture is a small iris in the lens of a camera. The larger the valve opening, the more light that will strike the sensor. The smaller the iris valve, the less light striking the sensor. The aperture also controls depth-of-field – the area in front of and behind the subject that is in focus. The larger the aperture, the shallower the depth of field. In some lenses and cameras the range of aperture size available will change depending on how much you zoom in or out.</p></p></div>


	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>bias</h3><p> Anything biased generally is one-sided and therefore lacks a neutral point of view. Bias can come in many forms and is often considered to be synonymous with prejudice. (<a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias</a>)</p></p></div>

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>bias (alt)</h3><p>An inclination toward something, prejudice, partiality, or predisposition. In journalism, bias appears when a journalist appears to consider one position, opinion, or source over another.

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>blog</h3><p> blog (short for weblog) is  a website that is made up of posts. Until 2009 blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject. More recently "multi-author blogs" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, interest groups and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into societal newstreams. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>close-up</h3><p>In filmmaking, television production and still photography a close-up tightly frames a person or an object. Close-ups are one of the standard shots used regularly with medium shots and long shots (cinematic techniques). Close-ups display the most detail, but they do not include the broader scene. Moving in to a close-up or away from a close-up is a common type of zooming.

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>compelling</h3><p>interesting, exciting, persuasive.</p></p></div>


	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>composition</h3><p>The foundation of good composition is the rule of thirds. The rule of thirds breaks down the frame into nine equal rectangles. Many smartphones will allow you to display the rule of thirds grid over the camera display. Please check the photography lesson for more information.</p></p></div>


	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>contrast</h3><p>Contrast in the imaging is the difference between the lights and the darks. If you have a picture that has little contrast, its usually very subdued. If you take an picture and turn down the contrast, the light parts of the pic become darker, and the dark parts become lighter. If you turn it up, the opposite happens. If you really turn it up a lot, you end up with only white and black, which works for some photos, but a very small percentage. Generally speaking, turning up the contrast makes the subject stand out a bit from the background.</p></p></div>


	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>cookie</h3><p>A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is usually a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser while a user is browsing a website. When the user browses the same website in the future, the data stored in the cookie can be retrieved by the website to notify the website of the user's previous activity. <br />Although cookies cannot carry viruses, and cannot install malware on the host computer, tracking cookies and especially third-party tracking cookies are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories.

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>cropping</h3><p>In the printing, graphic design and photography industries, cropping<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> refers to removing unwanted areas from a photographic or illustrated image.

	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>encryption</h3><p>Encryption is the process of encoding messages (or information) in such a way that eavesdroppers or hackers cannot read it, but that authorized parties can. In an encryption scheme, the message or information (referred to as plaintext) is encrypted using an encryption algorithm, turning it into an unreadable ciphertext. This is usually done with the use of an encryption key, which specifies how the message is to be encoded. Any adversary that can see the ciphertext should not be able to determine anything about the original message. An authorized party, however, is able to decode the ciphertext using a decryption algorithm, that usually requires a secret decryption key, that adversaries do not have access to. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually needs a key-generation algorithm to randomly produce keys. (<a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption</a>)</p></p></div>


	<div data-role="collapsible"><h3>encryption (alt)</h3><p>The process of obscuring information to make it unreadable without special knowledge, key files, and/or passwords.
