TERMS OF USE
Write about what users need to agree to to be a part of the awesome StoryMaker platform, or anything else you had in mind here. Woohoo! Maybe it’s a little longer. Whatever we to talk about. Do it here. Well, maybe not everything.

WHO WE ARE
We will refer to the application hereafter as “App” and the website as “Site.” 

USAGE GUIDELINES
something about the app here 

SOURCE CODE & LICENSING
The App source code is hosted publicly at https://github.com/guardianproject/mrapp/ and is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). The GPL is a copyleft license for general use, meaning that derived works can only be distributed under the same license terms. In other words, you're more than welcome to use the project's code in your own projects, but they must be similarly licensed.
